/**
 * Guice custom injectors.
 *
 * For most classes the normal Guice injectors are sufficient. However, to inject an IntelliJ service (those
 * registered as &lt;applicationService&gt; in <code>META-INF/plugin.xml</code>) use the
 * {@link org.metaborg.intellij.injections.IntelliJServiceProviderFactory}. To inject an IntelliJ component (those
 * registered in the &lt;application-components&gt; element of <code>META-INF/plugin.xml</code>) use the
 * {@link org.metaborg.intellij.injections.IntelliJComponentProviderFactory}. To inject another IntelliJ extension
 * (those registered in the &lt;extensions&gt; element of <code>META-INF/plugin.xml</code>),
 * use the {@link org.metaborg.intellij.injections.IntelliJExtensionProviderFactory}. To inject a Java service
 * (those registered in files under the <code>META-INF/services/</code> folder) use the
 * {@link org.metaborg.intellij.injections.JavaServiceProviderFactory}.
