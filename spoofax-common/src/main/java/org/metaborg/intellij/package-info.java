/**
 * The Spoofax for IntelliJ plugin's root package.
 *
 * This package contains the IntelliJ IDEA and JPS-specific packages,
 * and packages with functionality that is shared between IDEA and JPS.
 *
 * An IntelliJ plugin consists of two parts: the IDEA plugin and the JPS plugin.
 * The IDEA plugin is configured through the <code>META-INF/plugin.xml</code>
 * file. This file also describes the JPS plugin and its dependencies, as the
 * JPS plugin is run in a completely separate process from IntelliJ IDEA.
 *
 * To run or debug the IDEA plugin, use the <code>IntelliJ Plugin</code>
 * run/debug configuration or the <code>runIdea</code> Gradle task. You can
 * see whether the plugin was loaded correctly on the Settings/Plugin tab.
 *
 * To debug the JPS plugin, use the <code>IntelliJ Plugin (Debug JPS)</code>
 * run configuration or the <code>debugIdea</code> Gradle task,
 * and then connect a remote debugger (e.g. the <code>JPS Plugin</code> debug
 * configuration) to <code>localhost</code> port 5005.
