/**
 * General language management functionality.
 *
 * Metaborg Core does most of the language management. However, since we need to execute
 * additional steps before a language can be used in IntelliJ IDEA or JPS, we need to have control
 * over language loading, unloading, activation and deactivation. That's done in implementations
 * of the {@link org.metaborg.intellij.languages.ILanguageManager} interface.
