/**
 * Source annotations.
 *
 * IntelliJ IDEA invokes the {@link com.intellij.lang.annotation.ExternalAnnotator}
 * implementation (which by definition uses a slow external tool for annotation) to
 * gather information about the source code annotations (e.g. errors and warnings).
 *
 * First {@link com.intellij.lang.annotation.ExternalAnnotator#collectInformation}
 * is invoked, which collects some initial information from the IDE to support
 * annotation. This method should return quickly.
 *
 * Then {@link com.intellij.lang.annotation.ExternalAnnotator#doAnnotate}
 * is invoked on the collected information, which is expected to be a long-running
 * annotation pass. It is run in a separate thread.
 *
 * Finally {@link com.intellij.lang.annotation.ExternalAnnotator#apply)} is
 * invoked with the gathered annotations, which should apply them to the source file.
 * This is again expected to be a quick operation.
