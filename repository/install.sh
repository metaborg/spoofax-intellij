# This is just a little script that can be curled from the internet to
# install IntelliJ IDEA with Spoofax. It does some platform detection,
# downloads the binaries for IntelliJ IDEA and the Spoofax plugin,
# and installs then in the current directory or a specified directory.
# Optionally it can install Oracle JDK8 if no JDK was detected.

# This script is inspired by:
# https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/rustup-init.sh

# EXECUTION
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metaborg/spoofax-intellij/master/repository/install.sh -sSLf | bash
